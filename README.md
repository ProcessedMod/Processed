# UltraUtilities
### Another Utility Mod with different features

UltraUtilities is a mod which ads diffrent utilities based on processors. It's made for automation, block creation and more. 

## Automation
The automation won't be just one block, but in many steps for item processing. (Otherwise it would be too easy.)

## Energy
All blocks work without it! But to upgrade them, you have to use the Overload Processor which can be made of Overload Ingots. The ore can be found in the underground.

Planned Features:
- Auto Crafting Table
- Crafting Station in- and outputs using hoppers
- More building blocks
- Processor Sword Durability Upgrade
- And many more!

**Info**: This Mod is in the early alpha. It's not released yet. You can watch and star [this repository](https://github.com/UltraUtilities/UltraUtilities) to get it as one of the first.

You can make suggestions in the issues tab. Thanks!
